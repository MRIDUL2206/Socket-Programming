# Socket-Programming
<p>This repository contains a client-server model implemented using Java sockets, featuring basic multithreading capabilities. The system supports multiple clients connecting to the server simultaneously. Clients can specify the ID of another client they wish to communicate with, enabling sequential message exchanges between them.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> Utilizes Java sockets to establish a robust client-server communication model.</li>
    <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Allows multiple clients to connect and interact with the server concurrently.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Identification:</strong> Clients can specify the ID of another client to establish direct communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Message Exchange:</strong> Facilitates sequential message exchange between clients.</li>
</ul>
